Question 8
In the previous problem, our first answer added 'Dino' to the list like this:

flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "Bambam", "Pebbles"]
flintstones.append("Dino")

How can we add multiple items to our list (e.g., 'Dino' and 'Hoppy')? 
Replace the call to append with another method invocation.
'''

flintstones.extend(["Dino", "Hoppy"])
